# CyberCraftMC

Just an unfinished mod I made for a personal minecraft server. It was basically intended to be a "hacking" mod for minecraft where you could hack other players and whatnot, but I quickly got bored of the idea and decided to quit.

It features a custom library I made for GUI menus and includes a cellphone GUI along with the ability to purchase a custom FTP server capable of storing your inventory items. The FTP servers also come with an option to upgrade them (since..you know...they're *supposed* to be hacked by other players), with the only upgrade being added "so far" being the ability to have "full disk encryption" (i.e: when it gets hacked into it can't be used by the player without the encryption key)

The cellphone works, along with a "notification" library I added for the user to be able to get notifications (even when offline!). My first attempt at adding targets to hack was also *starting* to get implemented, but as you can tell that was the part where I essentially abandoned the project.

It comes with support for Vault, since economy is kind of a needed thing for this project.

I hope people find a better use for this than I did, and if people are willing to take over this project they can be my guest so long as they credit me for being the originator :)
